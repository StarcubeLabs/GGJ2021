# Change Log
All notable changes to “Ara Trails” will be documented in this file.

## [1.5.1] - 2020-10-19
### Added
- Added a "Custom" option in the simulation space dropdown, that lets you select a custom simulation space, in addition to "Self" and "World".

### Changed
- "Self" simulation space has been changed to mimic the behavior of Unity's ParticleSystem "Self" space. If you want the old "Self" space behavior back,
  switch the simulation space to "Custom" and select the trail's parent transform as the custom simulation space.

### Fixed
- Length misspelled as "Lenght"

## [1.5] - 2020-07-28
### Added
- New texture tiling mode: WorldTile. Texture coordinates are specified in each trail point upon being emitted, and they don't change over time.

### Changed
- Significant overall performance improvement.

## [1.4] - 2019-12-19
### Added
- Support for LWRP
- Quad mapping: This eliminates UV distortion when using the default triangle-strip trails. It relies on the shader accepting 4-component texture coordinates, and using tex2Dproj instead of tex2D.

### Fixed 
- Bug with incorrect tangent-space calculation when using explicit point orientation.

## [1.3] - 2019-01-31
### Added 
- Custom trail sections: trails can now take as input any shape to extrude along the trail's path.

## [1.2] - 2018-12-14
### Fixed 
- Bug that caused all cameras present in the scene to update the trail regardless of their layer culling mask.

## [1.1] - 2018-3-31
### Added 
- Sorting option: allows to alternate between two drawing orders: newer on top, or older on top (default).
### Fixed 
- Bug that caused UV coords for the first trail segment to be incorrect.

## [1.0.2] - 2018-3-31
### Added 
- Timescale option: allows to use unscaled time instead of regular delta time.
### Fixed 
- Bug that prevented passing float.PositiveInfinity as the points lifetime.


## [1.0.1] - 2018-3-06
### Fixed 
- Bug that caused the corner roundess feature to generate incorrect texture coordinates in certain cases.

### Added
- Warmup time for physical simulation of trails.

### Changed
- Order of inspector sections is now Overall > Lenght > Time > Emission > Phisics > Texture > Rendering.


## [1.0.0] - 2017-10-16
- Initial release.
